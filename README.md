#### Causes-of-child-and-infant-mortality-rates-in-Africa

### General Overview of the project

Child and infant mortality rates remain a critical issue in Africa, impeding progress toward several
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being. By leveraging
data-driven approaches, this hackathon aims to identify actionable insights, develop innovative
solutions, and contribute to global efforts to reduce preventable deaths in children under five years of age.
Objective
The primary objective is to utilize the provided datasets to uncover patterns, correlations, and key drivers of child and infant mortality in African countries. Participants will propose data-driven strategies and interventions that policymakers, healthcare providers, and organizations can adopt to improve health outcomes for children.
