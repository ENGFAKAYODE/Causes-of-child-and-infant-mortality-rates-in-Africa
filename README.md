## GENERAL OVERVIEW

Child and infant mortality rates remain a critical issue in Africa, impeding progress toward several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including Good Health and Well-being. By leveraging data-driven approaches, this project aims to identify actionable insights, develop innovative solutions, and contribute to global efforts to reduce preventable deaths in children under five years of age.

## OBJECTIVE

The primary objective is to utilize the provided datasets to uncover patterns, correlations, and key drivers of child and infant mortality in African countries. This project will propose data-driven strategies and interventions that policymakers, healthcare providers, and organizations can adopt to improve health outcomes for children.

1. Identify socioeconomic, healthcare, and environmental factors contributing to high mortality rates.
2. Propose actionable recommendations to address gaps in vaccination coverage, healthcare access, and maternal support.
3. Present insights in a format that is understandable to a non-technical audience.

## DATA SOURCE

The primary data source for this analysis is obtained from government health records, demographic surveys, and publicly available databases such as WHO and UNICEF reports.

## DATA TOOLS

- **Microsoft Excel:** Used for initial data storage, cleaning, and basic analysis.
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn):** For data processing, visualization, and statistical modeling.
- **SQL:** Used for querying large datasets and performing relational database analysis.
- **Tableau/Power BI:** Used to create interactive visualizations and dashboards for better insights.

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

- Assessing data quality and handling missing values.
- Identifying key trends, patterns, and anomalies in mortality rates.
- Conducting descriptive statistics to understand distribution and variance.
- Visualizing data using charts, histograms, and scatter plots to identify relationships.

## DATA ANALYSIS

- **Trend Analysis:** Examining historical child mortality rates to understand long-term patterns.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Identifying relationships between mortality rates and factors such as healthcare access, maternal education, and economic status.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Applying machine learning models to predict high-risk areas for infant mortality.
- **Impact Assessment:** Evaluating the effectiveness of past interventions and policies.

## RECOMMENDATION

- Improve maternal and child healthcare services by increasing access to prenatal and postnatal care.
- Enhance vaccination programs to cover vulnerable populations more effectively.
- Strengthen public health campaigns to educate communities on child healthcare and hygiene.
- Use data-driven insights to allocate healthcare resources efficiently and target high-risk regions.
