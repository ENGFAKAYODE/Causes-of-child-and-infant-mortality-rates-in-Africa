**General Overview of the project
**
Child and infant mortality rates remain a critical issue in Africa, impeding progress toward several
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including Good Health and Well-being. By leveraging
data-driven approaches, this project aims to identify actionable insights, develop innovative
solutions, and contribute to global efforts to reduce preventable deaths in children under five years of age.

**Objective
**The primary objective is to utilize the provided datasets to uncover patterns, correlations, and key drivers of child and infant mortality in African countries. I will propose data-driven strategies and interventions that policymakers, healthcare providers, and organizations can adopt to improve health outcomes for children.
1. Identify socioeconomic, healthcare, and environmental factors contributing to high mortality
rates.
2. Propose actionable recommendations to address gaps in vaccination coverage, healthcare
access, and maternal support.
3. Present insights in a format that is understandable to non-technical audience.
